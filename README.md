# Learning TypeScript

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing the **TypeScript** programming language.

## 📘 About

TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.  
This repo contains small code examples and practice files created while learning TypeScript.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

- Basic types (number, string, boolean, etc.)
- Arrays and Tuples
- Enums
- Interfaces and Types
- Functions with type annotations
- Classes and inheritance
- Generics
- Type narrowing and guards

## 📁 Structure

All `.ts` files are organized in the `/src` folder. Each file focuses on a specific concept or topic.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To run this code:

```bash
npm install
